Every word you say will be or can be used as a counter question so don’t bring any new topic that you aren’t confident about.
I have considered questions from all the companies that i interviewed including the one’s i didn’t crack. I cleared Javascript based rounds in last 9 companies. Mind you that there will be another 2/3 rounds based on Data Structure, Machine coding, Application design etc. HTML, CSS also plays a key role in Front End Interviews, so you should have good knowledge of HTML, CSS based Frontend Interview Questions.
